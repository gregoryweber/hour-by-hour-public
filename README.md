# HourByHour
Welcome to HourByHour's source code! This was my first time really digging deep into web development. The code is definitely shakey, and the tools definitely do not fit the project, but I learned a lot from developing it. The main purpose of this project was for me to experience what it was like to develop a web application from start to finish.
 

<h2>This project was made with a couple of different technologies:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>React</b> ‚öõÔ∏è for front end development </li>
 <li> <b>Express.js</b> ‚è© for back end server </li>
 <li> <b>GraphQl and Relay</b> üöÄ for queries</li>
 <li> <b>RethinkDB</b> üóÑÔ∏è for database </li>
 </ul>
 
I developed this project from August 2020 to September 2020.

<h3>Some Features I might implement in the future:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Forgot Password for Login Page</li>
   <li>Support for mobile (currently broken-ish on title page and editing events)</li>
   <li>Options for getting alerts via email or text about next events</li>
   <li>Desktop or mobile app</li>
  <ul>
