# HourByHour

LINK: https://hour-by-hour.herokuapp.com/

Welcome to HourByHour's source code! This was my first time really digging deep into web development. The code is definitely shakey, and the tools definitely do not fit the project, but I learned a lot from developing it. The main purpose of this project was for me to experience what it was like to develop a web application from start to finish, and to also host it on the web.

<h2>What is HourByHour?</h2>
HourByHour is a daily planner with a focus on the present day. You can create and edit events to put at different times. The current event will be displayed in full screen at the top. You can edit an event by clicking the pencil icon on the right hand side of each event. You can also delete events by clicking the delete button on the left hand side of each event. Add events using the plus button on the bottom of the screen.
 

<h2>This project was made with a couple of different technologies:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>React</b> ‚öõÔ∏è for front end development </li>
 <li> <b>Express.js</b> ‚è© for back end server </li>
 <li> <b>GraphQl and Relay</b> üöÄ for queries</li>
 <li> <b>RethinkDB</b> üóÑÔ∏è for database </li>
 </ul>
 
I developed this project from August 2020 to September 2020.

<h3>Some Features I might implement in the future:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Forgot Password for Login Page</li>
   <li>Support for mobile (currently broken-ish on title page and editing events)</li>
   <li>Options for getting alerts via email or text about next events</li>
   <li>Desktop or mobile app</li>
  <ul>
